# UpTask
Task Runner(Local and SSH) made in Python

#WIP
It's a Work in Progress :)

# For the Community and Beginners Like Me :)
The branch [basepackage](https://github.com/allanfreitas/uptask/tree/basepackage)
has a base TEMPLATE for you create your own package in python with and without command line scripts

# Some words about it :)
It's a tool to run tasks easily on Linux Servers using SSH,
or on local mode(It's on my next features list)

Like Fabric or Capistrano, It's for my needs to start,
but I hope it will serve to others :)
